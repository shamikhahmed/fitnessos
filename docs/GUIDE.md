## Smart Coach

Five personalities:

| Coach | Style |
|-------|-------|
| Maya | Sports Scientist |
| Alex | Drill Sergeant |
| Sam | Motivator |
| Zen | Mindful |
| Rex | Powerlifter |

Three tones: Motivational, Scientific, Hardcore.

Coach adapts to your goal (fat loss, strength, hypertrophy, recomp, athletic, maintenance) and signals deload when fatigue streaks build.

## Body map & measurements

- Interactive SVG — front/back, tap muscles for recovery status

**Readiness score (0–100)** from sleep, soreness, stress, energy, hydration, streak, injuries.

---

## Profiles

- Unlimited profiles — isolated `localStorage` per user
- **Demo mode** — pre-loaded with 16 workouts, 4 PRs
- Legacy migration imports old single-profile data automatically

---

## Settings essentials

- **8 themes** — Carbon (default cyan/purple), Aurora, Sunset, Midnight, Electric, Stealth, Forest, Light
- **6 training splits** — PPL, Upper/Lower, Full Body, Bro, Strength, Home
- **Equipment filter** — hides exercises you can't perform

---

## Offline & data

- All data in localStorage (`fos_profiles_[id]`)
- Service worker cache-first (`fos-v20`)
- No backend required
- Export JSON before device reset

---

## Tips

- Set injuries early — exercise library respects joint stress heatmap.
- Use Quick Workout when short on time.
- Check readiness before heavy compounds — coach deload signals are streak-based.
- Carbon theme uses `#00d5ff` + `#7b5fff` — switch in Settings → Appearance.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Nav missing | Complete intro + onboarding |
| Exercises empty | Check equipment filter in Settings |
| PR not detected | Ensure same exercise name as previous log |
| Data lost | Restore from Settings → Import JSON |
