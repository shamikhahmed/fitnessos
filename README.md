## What it is

FitnessOS Pro is a comprehensive fitness tracking PWA built entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no CDNs, no backend. It runs fully offline, installs on any device, and stores all data locally.

Built by Shamikh Ahmed across 14 development sessions as a production-grade personal project.

## Roadmap

High-value features that fit FitnessOS’s workout-first, offline-first, Apple-native direction:

1. **Apple Watch companion** — rest timer, set logging, and heart-rate-aware readiness synced via local QR/handoff (no cloud required).
2. **True AR physique overlay** — camera body-segmentation with measurement-calibrated muscle highlight (extends v4.4 preview).
3. **Offline video cache** — download wger/YouTube form clips during library sync for airplane-mode workouts.
4. **Periodisation planner** — mesocycle blocks with auto-deload tied to recovery debt and PR velocity.
5. **Gym floor mode** — extra-large tap targets, always-on display, haptic-only rest alerts for busy commercial gyms.
6. **HealthKit / Google Fit import** — sleep, steps, and weight pull to enrich readiness without manual check-ins.
7. **Plate calculator & bar math** — per-gym plate inventory (kg/lb) with visual loading diagram.
8. **Workout templates marketplace** — share/import JSON programs peer-to-peer (AirDrop-style) with no server.
9. **Voice set logging** — hands-free “135 for 8” parsing during compounds with spotter present.
10. **Progress photo timeline** — side-by-side physique photos aligned to measurement logs and archetype targets.

## Design Principles

- **Offline-first** — all data in localStorage, no API calls
- **iPhone-optimised** — tested on Safari 390px (XS Max → 16 Pro Max)
- **Zero framework** — vanilla JS only, `touch-action:manipulation` on all buttons
- **Dark-mode default** — cinematic design system with CSS custom properties
- **Progressive enhancement** — works without service worker, better with it
